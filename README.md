House Price Prediction Web Application

Welcome to the House Price Prediction project! This repository contains a web-based application designed to predict real estate prices in Bangalore, India, using a machine learning model. The app leverages Flask for the backend, with a trained Ridge Regression model to make predictions based on key input features.

Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to use a machine learning model to predict house prices in real-time. Users input house details such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms (BHK), and bathrooms, and the app provides an estimated price based on these features.

The prediction is made possible by a Ridge Regression model that has been trained on a dataset of Bangalore house prices. The model, once trained, is serialized using Pickle and loaded into the Flask web application for real-time predictions.

Features
Dynamic Location Selection: Users can choose from a list of predefined locations in Bangalore.
Real-Time Price Prediction: Based on user inputs, the app calculates an estimated house price using the trained machine learning model.
Responsive Design: The app uses Bootstrap for a clean and responsive user interface.


Project Structure
main.py: The core Flask application that handles routes, form submissions, and predictions.
RidgeModel.pkl: The pre-trained Ridge Regression model serialized using Pickle for making predictions.
Cleaned_data.csv: A cleaned dataset of Bangalore house prices, used to train the machine learning model.
index.html: The front-end HTML file, enhanced with Bootstrap, where users input their house details.


How It Works
User Inputs: Users provide details such as the location, square footage, number of bedrooms (BHK), and bathrooms.
Model Prediction: The Ridge Regression model processes the input and returns an estimated price, scaled appropriately.
Display Result: The predicted price is displayed on the web page in real-time.


Technologies Used
Python: Backend programming language.
Flask: Lightweight web framework for building the application.
Pandas: For data manipulation and handling the CSV dataset.
Scikit-learn: For building and loading the Ridge Regression model.
Bootstrap: For creating a responsive front-end interface.
